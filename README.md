# How to Add EPSG 6204 Coordinate System to AutoCAD Civil 3D for Macedonia
## Introduction
This repository provides a custom coordinate system file for AutoCAD Civil 3D, specifically designed to include the EPSG 6204 coordinate system for Macedonia. Since this system isn't available by default in Civil 3D, this file will be particularly useful for civil engineers and surveyors working on projects within Macedonia.

## Why EPSG 6204?
The EPSG 6204 coordinate system is essential for ensuring accurate and localized geodetic calculations for projects in Macedonia. Its absence in the standard AutoCAD Civil 3D setups can hinder the accuracy of civil engineering tasks.

## Getting Started
Step 1: Download the Coordinate System File
You can download the EPSG 6204 file directly from this repository. Navigate to the releases section where the latest version of the file is available for download.

Step 2: Import the File into AutoCAD Civil 3D
To import the coordinate system into AutoCAD Civil 3D, follow these steps:

Open AutoCAD Civil 3D.
Type MAPCSLIBRARYIMPORT in the command line. This command allows you to import coordinate system libraries.
Navigate to the location where you saved the downloaded file and select it.
